## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I leaned to place the content inside a div, using flexbox and grid. It was hard for me, because that was the first project I tried for myself. 

I used a few tools to solve this challenge, for example: ChatGPT (I used ChatGPT for simple stuff, like box-shadow, letter-spacing). And I probably repeat the same code for a lot of things, but I tried to remove those repeated codes, but that's not clearly for me already.

### Continued development

For my future projects, I'll try to do the mobile first, so I can be better for responsive challenges.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) - This helped me for simple stuff that I didn't know before.
- [Mozilla DOCS - CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS) - I used this site, to learn a few CSS properties.
